# Vim as my editor

## Organization

The folder contains important topics of vim usage. Files are added as I learn/practice these topics

## Plugins

### lervag/vimtex

vimtex is a vim plugin that 'provides convenient functionality for editing LaTeX documents'.

vimtex provides mappings that change, delete and toggle commands, delimiters and environments (see the ds, cs and ts family of mappings) (vimtex-dfault-mapings). These mappings are inspired by surround.vim by Tim Pope

the default local-leader key is \
(check dotfiles/vimrc, but changed to ,)

,ll to compile
,le to vimtex-errors
,lk to stop
,lk to stop all
,lL to compile only selected lines
,lt to vimtex-toc-open
,lT to vimtex-toc-toggle 

F6 to surround something
]] to navigate faster

### sirver/ultisnips
UltiSnips is awesome.
### dracula/vim
not productive at all, but can provide some deeper understanding about highlighting, color schemes, etc.
### junegunn/fzf 
fzf is a really nice toll, and it can be more productive to use it without leaving the text editor.
### nanotee/zoxide
zoxide is nice too, and I want to know what are the benefits of using it inside vim instead.
### others
I don't think NerdTree so attractive, so I don't want to use it.
