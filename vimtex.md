vimtex is a vim plugin that 'provides convenient functionality for editing LaTeX documents'.

vimtex provides mappings that change, delete and toggle commands, delimiters and environments (see the ds, cs and ts family of mappings) (vimtex-dfault-mapings). These mappings are inspired by surround.vim by Tim Pope
