Why bothering installing tmuxp

## Commands

tmuxp helps me with my daily tmux sessions. It offers a lot of commands and is really powerful.

In my case, it helps me enormously. And I only use 2 commands.

### tmuxp freeze
### tmuxp load

## Configuration

## YAML files

# Extra

## Aliases

Some aliases I use in bash

```
alias tf='tmuxp freeze'
alias tl='tmuxp load'
```
